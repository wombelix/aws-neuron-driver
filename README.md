# AWS Neuron Driver

## Disclaimer

**This is a personal project and not related to,
or endorsed by, Amazon Web Services.**

-----

This repository contains all available versions of the AWS Neuron Driver
source code (`GPL-2.0-only` license). A Linux kernel device driver
supporting the AWS Neuron SDK.

There is **no** independent development of features or bug fixes done in this repository.
It is basically a mirror of the source code as it is released by AWS.

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/git.sr.ht/~wombelix/aws-neuron-driver)](https://api.reuse.software/info/git.sr.ht/~wombelix/aws-neuron-driver)

## Why

The [official repository](https://github.com/aws-neuron/aws-neuron-driver)
doesn't contain recent versions of the driver source code. The driver is still
open source (`GPL-2.0-only` license), but only distributed as rpm package
with a DKMS wrapper. Releases since
[October 2020](https://github.com/aws-neuron/aws-neuron-driver/commits/master/)
are not available as archive or in a public git repository.

## How

The tool [aws-neuron-driver-publish-source](https://git.sr.ht/~wombelix/aws-neuron-driver-publish-source)
is used to add releases and code updates to this unofficial repository.
Checksum and GPG verifications are performed and metadata added.
This creates an audit trail and allows independent validation
that the code is coming from the official repository
[yum.repos.neuron.amazonaws.com](https://yum.repos.neuron.amazonaws.com/)
and wasn't altered.

### Folder structure

```
src/            =   AWS Neuron Driver source code
archive/        =   Public GPG Key and repo xml files
        rpm/    =   RPM files with SHA256 checksums
```

The `archive/` folder contains copies of various files processed while
adding a new Neuron Driver source code version to the repository.
They can be used to verify and validate the authenticity of the code in `src/`.

### Example commit message

Every commit of a new Driver version contains additional Metadata. If available,
[Release Notes](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/release-notes/runtime/aws-neuronx-dkms/index.html)
are added as well. These commits are also tagged with the version number.

## When

Source code updates are published automatically through two mechanisms:

### GitHub Actions Workflow

A [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/check-neuron-driver.yml)
runs every Sunday at 3:17 AM UTC and can be triggered manually. The
workflow compares the latest AWS Neuron Driver release notes with
the local copy. If changes are detected, it triggers an sr.ht build
to publish new source code.

### sr.ht Build Manifest

The [sr.ht build manifest](.build.yaml) contains a `publish` task that
downloads and compares release notes from the official AWS repository.
It only proceeds if new releases are detected. The task builds and runs
the [aws-neuron-driver-publish-source](https://git.sr.ht/~wombelix/aws-neuron-driver-publish-source)
tool, commits and pushes new driver source code with metadata. It uses
the `skip-ci` option to prevent infinite build loops.

This ensures the repository stays current with official AWS releases automatically.

## Usage

Please refer to [src/README.md](src/README.md) for technical details about the driver,
as well as usage and build instructions.

## Source

The primary location is:
[git.sr.ht/~wombelix/aws-neuron-driver](https://git.sr.ht/~wombelix/aws-neuron-driver)

Mirrors are available on
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/wombelix/aws-neuron-driver),
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/wombelix/aws-neuron-driver)
and
[GitHub](https://github.com/wombelix/aws-neuron-driver).

## Contribute

I don't intend to make changes to the `aws-neuron-driver` source
in any way in this repository. So, contributions are limited to
content outside the `src/` and `archive/` sub-folders.

With this limitation in mind, please don't hesitate to provide Feedback,
open an Issue or create a Pull / Merge Request.

Just pick the workflow or platform you prefer and are most comfortable with.

Feedback, bug reports or patches to my sr.ht list
[~wombelix/inbox@lists.sr.ht](https://lists.sr.ht/~wombelix/inbox) or via
[Email and Instant Messaging](https://dominik.wombacher.cc/pages/contact.html)
are also always welcome.
